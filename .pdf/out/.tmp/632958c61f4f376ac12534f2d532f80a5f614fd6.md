:::</p><p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/opt/dita-ot/data/extend/extend-desktop/iframe-sample.md" xtrc="p:2;182:3">This sample app is made to showcase two important abilities of the ZLUX App framework.
The first is the ability to bring web content into ZLUX that is non-native, that is, that is not developed with ZLUX in mind or written around an unsupported framework (As opposed to Angular or other supported frameworks).
This is accomplished by providing a wrapper that brings web content into ZLUX by utilizing an iframe wrapped in an Angular shell.
Content within an IFrame interacts with content in a webpage differently than content which isn't in an IFrame, so the second purpose of this App is to show that even when in an IFrame, your content can still accomplish App-to-App communication as made possible by the ZLUX App framework.</p><p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/opt/dita-ot/data/extend/extend-desktop/iframe-sample.md" xtrc="p:3;182:3">This app presents a few fields which allow you to launch another App, or communicate with an already open App instance, in both cases with some context that the other App may interpret and some action.</p><p class="- topic/p " xtrf="file:/opt/dita-ot/data/extend/extend-desktop/iframe-sample.md" xtrc="p:4;182:3">:::warning
