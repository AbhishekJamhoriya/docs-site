## Create a User Profile
You can create an `mq` user profile to avoid typing your connection details on every command. An `mq` profile contains the host, port, username, and password for the MQ Rest API server of your choice. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them as needed.

**Follow these steps:**

1.  Create an `mq` profile: 

    ```
    zowe profiles create mq-profile <profileName> --host <hostname> --port <portnumber> --user <username> --password <password> --rejectUnauthorized false
    ```
    
    The result of the command displays as a success or failure message. You can use your profile when you issue commands in the mq command group.

**Tip:** For more information about the syntax, actions, and options, for a profiles create command, open Zowe CLI and issue the following command:

```
zowe profiles create mq-profile -h
```
